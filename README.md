Axpe_SearchFilters_Test

DEFINITION

I have used to assemble the project with Vite + React, TypeScript, Vitest, Testing Library...

I decided to use vite, for its speed and lightness. It is one of the options recommended by the react official documentation.

I decided not to "componetize" more than necessary, I could have created an item component for each child, but I didn't find it necessary for this case.

As for the testing, I have created quite light tests, without going too deep.

I wanted at all times to stick to the 4 hours stipulated for develop the app.

FACILITY

Axpe_SearchFilters_Test is developed in React, mounted by Vite like package builder. So for the installation of dependencies it is necessary to have Node and Vite. Once both are installed, go to the root of the project and run "npm install" to install all the necessary dependencies.

TESTING

To launch the tests, go to the root of the project and execute "npm run test" in the console. All tests it detects will start.
